Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods are increasingly being used to mine knowledge from unstructured health texts. Recent advances in health text processing techniques are encouraging researchers and health domain experts to go beyond just reading the information included in published texts (e.g. academic manuscripts, clinical reports, etc.) and structured questionnaires, to discover new knowledge by mining health contents. This has allowed other perspectives to surface that were not previously available.

Over the years, many eHealth challenges have attempted to identify, classify, extract, and link knowledge, such as Semevals, CLEF campaigns, and others.

The eHealth-KD 2021 proposes modeling the human language in a scenario in which Spanish electronic health documents could be machine-readable from a semantic point of view. With this task, we expect to encourage the development of software technologies to automatically extract a large variety of knowledge from eHealth documents written in the Spanish Language.

Even though this challenge is oriented to the health domain, the structure of the knowledge to be extracted is general-purpose. The semantic structure proposed models four types of information units. Each one represents a specific semantic interpretation, and they make use of thirteen semantic relations among them. Furthermore, although the challenge will contain a majority of Spanish sentences in the health domain, it will also include a small selection of sentences from different domains and languages (i.e., English) to encourage cross-domain and multi-lingual approaches. **Participants can opt-out of this additional requirement at evaluation time.**

The following sections provide a detailed presentation of each unit and relation type. An example is provided in the following picture.

This challenge can be of interest to experts in the field of natural language processing, specifically for those working on automatic knowledge extraction and discovery. It is not a requirement to have expertise in health text processing for dealing with the eHealth-KD task, due to the general purpose of the semantic schema defined. Nevertheless, eHealth researchers could find interesting this challenge to evaluate their technologies that rely on health domain knowledge.

## Description of the Subtasks

To simplify the evaluation process, two subtasks are presented:

1. [Entity recognition](/2021/tasks#subtask-a-entity-recognition)
2. [Relation extraction](/2021/tasks#subtask-b-relation-extraction)

## Submissions and evaluation

There are four evaluation scenarios:

1. [A main scenario covering both tasks](/2021/tasks#main-evaluation-scenario-1)
2. [An optional scenario evaluating subtask A](/2021/tasks#optional-subtask-a-scenario-2)
3. [An optional scenario evaluating subtask B](/2021/tasks#optional-subtask-b-scenario-3)

> üìù Details about the submission format will be provided shortly.

## Resources

All the data will be made available to participants in due time. This includes training, development and test data, as well as evaluation scripts and sample submissions. [More details are provided here](/2021/resources).

All the resources are available in the [eHealth-KD corpora repository](https://github.com/ehealthkd/corpora).

## Submission

The challenge will be graded on [Codalab.org](https://competitions.codalab.org). Check out the [submission instructions](/2021/submission) for more details. There is an ongoing [training competition](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/30333) already hosted where you can try your system on the training dataset and development, to get acquainted with the submission workflow.

## Publication instructions

> üìù Official instructions and templates for the description paper will be provided shortly.

The Organization Committee of eHealth-KD encourages participants to submit a description paper of their systems. Submitted papers will be reviewed by a scientific committee, and only accepted papers will be published at CEUR. The proceedings of eHealth-KD will be jointly published with the proceedings of all tasks of IberLEF 2020. The submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by a Program Committee which is composed by all the participants and the Organization Committee.

Articles must be written in English.
The document format can be Word or LaTeX, but the submission must be in PDF format.
Please make sure to follow all the additional instructions provided in the template and respect the layout and formatting.

Depending on the final number of participants and the time allocated for the workshop, all or a selected group of papers will be presented and discussed in the Workshop session.
